## Get started

Start by adding the package to your dependencies:

```bash
npm i @oceanprotocol/squid --save
```

The package exposes `Ocean` and `Logger` which you can import in your code like this:

```js
// ES6
import { Ocean, Logger } from '@oceanprotocol/squid'

// ES2015
const { Ocean, Logger } = require('@oceanprotocol/squid')
```

You can then connect to a running [Keeper](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts) & [Aquarius](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius) instance, e.g.:

```js
const ocean: Ocean = await Ocean.getInstance({
    // the node of the blockchain to connect to, could also be infura
    nodeUri: "http://localhost:8545",
    // the uri of aquarius
    aquariusUri: "http://localhost:5000",
    // the uri of brizo
    brizoUri: "http://localhost:8030",
    // the uri to the parity node you want to use for encryption and decryption
    parityUri: "http://localhost:9545",
    // the uri of the secret store that holds the keys
    secretStoreUri: "http://localhost:12001",
    // the threshold of nodes from the secre store that have to agree to the decrypt
    threshold: 0,
    // the password for the account (in the local parity node) used to sign messages for secret store
    password: "you password",
    // the address of the account (in the local parity node) used to sign messages for secret store
    address: "0xed243adfb84a6626eba46178ccb567481c6e655d",
})
```

### Examples

* [Examples](/src/examples/)
* [Tuna](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/tuna/tree/develop/node)

## Documentation

**[Docs: squid-js API Reference ‚Üí](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/references/squid-js/)**

Alternatively, you can generate the raw TypeDoc documentation locally by running:

```bash
# will output to ./doc folder
npm run doc
```

## Development

To start development you need to:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

### Testing

To start unit tests you need to:

```bash
ganache-cli &
npm run test
```

or to watch for changes

```bash
ganache-cli &
npm run test:watch
```

to create code coverage

```bash
ganache-cli &
npm run test:cover
```

This will start a watcher for changes of the code.

`ganache-cli` can be installed following [this instructions](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli#installation).

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

### npm releases

For a new **patch release**, execute on the machine where you're logged into your npm account:

```bash
./bumpversion path
```

git tag with the latest version and `git push`
