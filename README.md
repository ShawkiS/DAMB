Digital Asset Monetize Button


How this works? 
1. Your URL is encripted and is given a DID using Ocean Protocol 
2. You set a price on your asset in $, under the hood it is priced in Ocean tokens based on current exchange rates 
3. You publish this asset on the blockchain by signing using metamask. The account used to sign is the token receiving wallet. 
4. Receive tokens for each download based on the traffic generated for the button.
